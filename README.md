Our web app is a fun Creative Writing exercise! To start writing a story, visitors to our page will need to Sign Up or Login with their Google account. This Sign Up/Login feature was added to our web app using Google's OAuth API.

Once logged in, users can create stories, which are centered around three random images generated using the Unsplash API. All user stories are saved to a database, and all visitors to the page can rate stories through "likes". Are you stumped and still can't come up with a story on your own? No problem - just browse all user stories and gain inspiration from other story writers! User stories are grouped by Top Rated (most likes) and Latest.
