NervousDonut is a blog site that fosters creativity through writing by providing writing prompts in the form of three randomly-generated images.

To start writing a story, users will need to sign up or login through Google OAuth. Once logged in, users can create stories, which are centered around three random images generated using the Unsplash API. All user stories are saved to a postgreSQL database. Visitors to the page can rate stories through "likes." If you're stumped and still can't come up with a story on your own, no problem - just browse all user stories and gain inspiration from other writers. User stories are grouped by Top Rated (most likes) and Latest.
